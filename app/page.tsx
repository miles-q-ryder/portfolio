						Howdy, I'm a senior at Texas A&M University, based out of Galveston,
						pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. As a software
						developer, I enjoy tackling complex problems and creating practical,
						user-focused solutions. I'm especially interested in web and app
						development, and I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and
						apply my skills. Below you can explore some of my recent projects
						that showcase my work and problem-solving approach. If you'd like to
						connect or have any questions, my contact information is provided at
